### Introduction
Biobb (BioExcel building blocks) packages are Python building blocks that
create new layer of compatibility and interoperability over popular
bioinformatics tools.
The latest documentation of our biobb collections can be found in our readthedocs sites:
- [biobb_io](http://biobb_io.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [\[GitHub\]](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_io): Biobb collection to fetch data to be consumed by the rest of the Biobbs.
- [biobb_model](http://biobb_model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [\[GitHub\]](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_model): Biobb collection to check and model 3d protein structures.
- [biobb_md](http://biobb_md.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [\[GitHub\]](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_md): Biobb collection to perform molecular dynamics simulations.
